#### Description: 

A soccer fixtures tracking site using data from football-data.org

The technologies used for this website are:

1. Flask for backend of the site, using python and Jinja to dynamically generate HTML and collect API data to display the information requested by the user

2. HTML and CSS to display the information as envisioned. These are primarily responsible for the minimalist dark mode look and feel. Bootstrap 5 components are heavily used throughout

3. Javascript to add nice effects to make the pages seem more responsive and modern to users. This is a language I'd like to develop my skills further in as it's used so widely and is so versatile
